### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸ”­ I always work on some cool stuff in my free time (okay, of course, it depends on what you consider cool. :wink:),
- :fire: I am always looking for something new to learn,
- :alarm_clock: like most of us, I don't have much time,
- ðŸŒ± currently, i.e. since 2021, I am experimenting with Apple Playgrounds
